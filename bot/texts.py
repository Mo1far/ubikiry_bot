    Welcome to the CryptoTribunal Bot! I am a small part of our global CryptoTribunal project. We provide a platform for consolidating defrauded token holders in order to take collective actions towards persecuting fraudulent projects. 

Please visit our website https://cryptotribunal.org/ if you need more information about our project.

Here is how the platform works:
1.  We will have two types of participants; victims and the legal professionals that will work on the case such as lawyers, detectives, analysts, etc. 
2. We will predominantly work with fraudulent projects where money has been collected using the founders/team’s real names, and where there is a high possibility that the raised funding can be obtained and returned.
3. To organize interaction within the community, we planned to create a private blockchain with representatives of the community movement (like an association of lawyers) given supervisory rights.
4. All fraudulent projects will be ranked by the amount of stolen funds and the activity of the community.
5. In order to finance each stage of the procedure, there will be a small fundraising event. If we reach a certain stage and it becomes clear that what we are doing has no prospect of succeeding, we would have avoided expending huge sums on useless research. Otherwise, the work continues until we get the result we are all after!
