CRYPTO TRIBUNAL
+++++++++++++++
Since the start of Bitcoin many scams have arisen in the crypto scene. Billions have gone missing in scam ICO's and IEO's!

Because of that we founded the Crypto Tribunal, a platform where you as an investor get a voice! And not just a voice, you even get the possibility to have your funds returned; Even when you got scammed years ago we can seek justice for you!

The goal of the Crypto Tribunal is to return the funds to the investors and by doing so simultaneously return trust to the crypto scene as well.
